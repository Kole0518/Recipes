Ingredients:
- 2 perfectly ripe medium avacados
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 3 eggs
- 2 cups flour
- 1.5 tsp baking powder
- pinch of salt

Scoop out avacados into a large bowl and mash. 
Combine with the sugar and mix. 
Then add the eggs and beat thoroughly.

In a separate bowl, add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix.
Combine dry with wet, fold and mix to form a batter.
If it looks like guacamole, you did it right.

Bake at 350 for 45-50 mins.
